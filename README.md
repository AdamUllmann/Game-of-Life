This project is an interactive graphical simulation of Conway's Game of Life and many other 2D cellular automata. It's built using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) graphics library, offering a clean efficient, and fully interactive way to visualize the evolution of 2D cellular automata.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid**: Adjusts to the size of the window.
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Pause/Resume the simulation.
  - Randomize the grid population.
  - Clear the grid.
  - Zoom in and out.
  - Adjust the speed of the simulation.
- **High Frame Rate**: Runs at up to 480 FPS for a smooth visual experience.

## Controls

- `Left Mouse Button`: Activate a cell.
- `Right Mouse Button`: Deactivate a cell.
- `Mouse Wheel`: Zoom in and out.
- `SPACE`: Pause/Resume the simulation.
- `UP Arrow`: Increase the simulation speed.
- `DOWN Arrow`: Decrease the simulation speed.
- `R`: Randomize the grid.
- `C`: Clear the grid.
- `H`: Hide/Show Controls
- `ENTER`: Hide/Show Rules Menu
